# Vonage Quickstart Examples for Java

<img src="https://developer.nexmo.com/assets/images/Vonage_Nexmo.svg" height="48px" alt="Nexmo is now known as Vonage" />

Quickstarts also available for: [Python](https://github.com/Vonage/vonage-python-code-snippets), [.NET](https://github.com/Vonage/vonage-dotnet-code-snippets), [Node.js](https://github.com/Vonage/vonage-node-code-snippets), [PHP](https://github.com/Vonage/vonage-php-code-snippets),  [Ruby](https://github.com/Vonage/vonage-ruby-code-snippets) and [curl](https://github.com/Vonage/vonage-curl-code-snippets).

The purpose of the quickstart guide is to provide simple examples focused on one goal. For example, sending an SMS, handling an incoming SMS webhook, making a Text to Speech call. These code samples are meant to be used for https://developer.nexmo.com/, and are structured in such a way as to be used for internal testing. Developers are free to use these code snippets as a reference, but these may require changes to be worked into your specific application. We recommend checking out the Vonage Developer Website, which displays these code snippets in a more copy/paste fashion.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

To use this sample you will first need a [Vonage account][sign-up].

For some of the examples you will need to [buy a number][buy-number].

## üìö Building The Library

You will need to have [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) installed to build the code. Once
you have gradle installed, run the following to build a jar that contains
the quickstart code along with all the vonage server sdk dependencies:

```sh
gradle assemble
```

This will build the following file: `build/libs/vonage-java-code-snippets-with-dependencies.jar`

## üìã Running The Examples

Copy `.env-example` to `.env` and edit the values. You'll need to load those
values into environment variables, so you'll probably want to use a tool like
[Foreman](https://github.com/ddollar/foreman) to run your code like this:

```sh
foreman run java -cp build/libs/vonage-java-code-snippets-with-dependencies.jar PACKAGE.CLASS
```

So to run the OutboundTextToSpeechExample class, you would run the following:

```sh
foreman run java -cp build/libs/vonage-java-code-snippets-with-dependencies.jar com.vonage.quickstart.voice.OutboundTextToSpeech
```

If you set the environment variable `QUICKSTART_DEBUG` to any value, extra information
will be output to the console from the Vonage Server SDK.
